# Task-Manager

Overview: Task Manager is a web app that helps you manage your tasks easily. It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and has a simple, purple-themed design. You can use the app to add, edit, delete, and organize your tasks. Each task has a title, description, due date, and priority level, all of which you can update. On the main screen, tasks are shown in three groups: Upcoming Tasks, Overdue Tasks, and Completed Tasks, making it easy to see the status of your tasks.
