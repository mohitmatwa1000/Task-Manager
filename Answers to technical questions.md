1) How long did you spend on the coding test?
   It took me about 4 hours to work on the HTML and CSS. The CSS took a little longer because I had to plan the theme, colors, and design.
   I spent around 1.5 hours on the JavaScript part, which included adding localStorage to save task data and other features.
   Finally, I spent another hour improving the design to make it look better and easier to use. In total, it took me around 7 hours.

2) What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
   I think the most useful feature added to JavaScript in recent versions is the localStorage API.
   This feature lets web apps store data on the user's device, so it stays even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.

3) How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
   I have not yet had the opportunity to track down a performance issue in a production environment. 

4) If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
   I could have made the app responsive, or added a signup/login feature so different users could access their own tasks.
